An HTML/CSS/JavaScript website for generating the cast of a play where all the actors have learned 2 parts. 

## Features

- Coin flip animation created with CSS keyframes
- Uses jQuery to display actor names and headshots under their roles
- Once the full cast is generated (6 flips), it is turned into a downloadable .png image with HTML canvas

###### This cast-generator was created for a production of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night by Sydney-based independent theatre company Virginia Plain. The actors all learned 2 parts and flipped a (real) coin once the audience was seated to decided the cast of that performance.
